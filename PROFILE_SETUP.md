# Adding Your Profile Picture

Your portfolio is now set up to display your profile picture in both the Hero and About sections!

## ðŸ“¸ Adding Your Profile Picture

### Step 1: Prepare Your Image
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 400x400px (square format works best)
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Quality**: Professional headshot with good lighting
- **Background**: Clean background preferred

### Step 2: Add the Image
1. Save your profile picture as `profile.jpg` or `profile.png`
2. Place it in the `public/images/` directory
3. Replace the existing placeholder file

### Step 3: Update the Path (if needed)
If you use a different filename, update `data/profile.json`:
```json
{
  "profileImage": "/images/your-image-name.jpg"
}
```
